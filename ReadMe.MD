# Vehicle Detection Using CNN

This project performs binary image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect whether an image contains a **vehicle** or **not**.

---

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle:

ðŸ”— [Vehicle Detection Image Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brsdincer/vehicle-detection-image-set/data)

**Important:** You must download the dataset manually from Kaggle and place the contents as follows:

```
data/
â”œâ”€â”€ vehicles/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ img1.png
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ img2.png
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ non-vehicles/
    â”œâ”€â”€ img1.png
    â”œâ”€â”€ img2.png
    â””â”€â”€ ...
```
